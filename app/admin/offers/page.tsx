// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the code uses array methods like `filter`, `map`, or `reduce` where these variables
// might be used as shorthand within a callback function.  Without the original code, I can only
// provide a placeholder fix by explicitly declaring these variables before they are potentially used.
// A proper fix would involve examining the original code and ensuring the variables are correctly
// defined within the scope where they are used, or renaming them if they clash with existing variables.

// Placeholder declarations to satisfy the "undeclared variable" errors.
// These might need to be adjusted based on the actual code.
// const brevity = null;
// const it = null;
// const is = null;
// const correct = null;
// const and = null;

// Assuming the rest of the original code follows here.
// Without the original code, I cannot provide a more specific solution.
// Please replace this comment with the actual content of src/app/admin/offers/page.tsx.
