// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the code uses 'it', 'is', 'correct', and 'and' without proper declaration or import.
// Without the original code, I can only provide a hypothetical fix by declaring these variables.
// This is a placeholder and needs to be replaced with the actual fix based on the original code.

// Hypothetical fix:
const brevity = true; // Or false, depending on its intended use
const it = true; // Or false, or a string, or a function, depending on its intended use
const is = true; // Or false, or a string, or a function, depending on its intended use
const correct = true; // Or false, or a string, or a function, depending on its intended use
const and = true; // Or false, or a string, or a function, depending on its intended use

// The rest of the original code would go here, presumably using the above variables.
// This is a placeholder.  The actual code from src/app/admin/service-areas/page.tsx
// needs to be inserted here, and the above variable declarations adjusted accordingly.

// Example of how the variables might be used (replace with actual code):
if (it && is && correct && and && brevity) {
  console.log("All conditions are true");
} else {
  console.log("At least one condition is false");
}
